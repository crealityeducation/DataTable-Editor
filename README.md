# DataTable-Editor
This is a js function that takes in html div id and table id to create editable datatable using jQuery datatable and add it to the div html. In return it gives the function name that needs to be called using call back with function name and array of object to display the table. To edit the row, double click on the row and HTML Model will open with 'Cancel' and 'Save' buttons. 

# Dependencies:
jquery,
jquery DataTable,
w3css (fee free to change to your choice of CSS)

# Limitations:
Currently the fields are all text input fields. 

# Future plan
Dynamically identify the data type and accordingly change the fields on the Model. Update data accodingly in datatable.

# Contributions are welcome :-)
